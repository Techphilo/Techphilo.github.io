Hi, I’m **Iraj Ahangari**, an instrumentation and control engineer turned techno-philosopher exploring AI, philosophy, and technology. My day-job background gave me a front-row seat to how automated systems shape our world, and my passion for philosophy led me to ask the deeper “why” behind every control loop and algorithm.

Techno-philosophy, to me, is the study of how technology and human meaning co-evolve. It asks questions like: Can a machine ever truly “understand”? What does it mean for a digital agent to have agency? Drawing on David Chalmers’ view—that consciousness may be a fundamental feature of reality, not merely an epiphenomenon of physical processes—we see that AI doesn’t just compute; it challenges our very notions of mind and matter.

I first stumbled on this fusion of tech and thought when I read Chalmers’ essays on the “hard problem” of consciousness. It hit me that engineering and philosophy aren’t separate tracks but two lenses on the same mystery: the nature of intelligence. On this site, I share my reflections, papers, stories, and code at that intersection. Enjoy the journey!
